# langChain_output_prasers

 Output Parsers in LangChain help convert raw LLM responses into structured formats like
JSON, CSV, Pydantic models, and more. They ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in
applications.


The StrOutputParser is the simplest output parser in LangChain. It is used to parse the output
of a Language Model (LLM) and return it as a plain string.


The JsonOutputPraser helps to parse the output of llm into json(no schema)


StructuredOutputParser is an output parser in LangChain that helps extract structured JSON
data from LLM responses based on predefined field schemas.
It works by defining a list of fields (ResponseSchema) that the model should return, ensuring
the output follows a structured format.(no validation)


PydanticOutputParser is a structured output parser in LangChain that uses Pydantic models to enforce schema validation when processing LLM responses.

Strict Schema Enforcement Ensures that LLM responses follow a well-defined structure.

Type Safety - Automatically converts LLM outputs into Python objects.

Easy Validation → Uses Pydantic's built-in validation to catch incorrect or missing data.

Seamless Integration Works well with other LangChain components.
